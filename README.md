# Nuclear Energy Outreach  
### A Nuclear Power Plant of Prejudices

This repository contains the materials for a public science presentation on **nuclear energy**, delivered as part of a scientific outreach initiative.

The presentation aims to address widespread misconceptions surrounding nuclear power by providing a **physics-based, data-driven analysis** of nuclear energy production, safety, costs, and waste management.

## Project Overview

Nuclear energy is often described as:
- dangerous  
- excessively expensive  
- unnecessary  
- overly complex  

This project critically examines these claims using concepts from:
- nuclear and reactor physics  
- engineering design and safety systems  
- historical case studies  
- official data from international scientific institutions  

The goal is to promote **scientific literacy and critical thinking**, separating evidence-based facts from media narratives and public prejudice.

## Topics Covered

- Fundamentals of nuclear fission and reactor operation  
- Moderators, control rods, and reactor criticality

## Background and Inspiration

This project was inspired in part by the book *L’avvocato dell’atomo* by Luca Romano,
which promotes a science-based public discussion on nuclear energy.
The presentation expands on these ideas by integrating physics concepts,
technical analysis, and additional case studies.

## Presentation Notes

For correct visualization of animations, a recent version of Microsoft PowerPoint
with support for the *Morph* transition is recommended.
